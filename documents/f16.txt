The General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon is a single-engine supersonic multirole fighter aircraft originally developed by General Dynamics (now Lockheed Martin) for the United States Air Force (USAF). Designed as an air superiority day fighter, it evolved into a successful all-weather multirole aircraft. Over 4,600 aircraft have been built since production was approved in 1976. Although no longer being purchased by the U.S. Air Force, improved versions are being built for export customers. In 1993, General Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing business to the Lockheed Corporation, which in turn became part of Lockheed Martin after a 1995 merger with Martin Marietta.

The Fighting Falcon's key features include a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility, side-mounted control stick to ease control while maneuvering, an ejection seat reclined 30 degrees from vertical to reduce the effect of g-forces on the pilot, and the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire flight control system which helps to make it an agile aircraft. The F-16 has an internal M61 Vulcan cannon and 11 locations for mounting weapons and other mission equipment. The F-16's official name is "Fighting Falcon", but "Viper" is commonly used by its pilots and crews, due to a perceived resemblance to a viper snake as well as the Colonial Viper starfighter from the television program Battlestar Galactica which aired at the time the F-16 entered service.

In addition to active duty in the U.S. Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, and Air National Guard units, the aircraft is also used by the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds aerial demonstration team, and as an adversary/aggressor aircraft by the United States Navy. The F-16 has also been procured to serve in the air forces of 25 other nations. As of 2015, it was the world's most numerous fixed-wing aircraft in military service.

The F-16 was designed to be relatively inexpensive to build and simpler to maintain than earlier fighters. The airframe is built with about 80% aviation aluminum alloys, 8% steel, 3% composites, and 1.5% titanium. The control surfaces are made of bonded aluminum honeycomb structure and graphite epoxy laminate skins. The F-16 has a single engine, the Pratt & Whitney F100 or the General Electric F110, which provides a thrust-to-weight ratio greater than one, allowing the aircraft to accelerate vertically.

The F-16's versatility has been proven in numerous conflicts. It has been used for air-to-air combat, ground attack, and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD). The aircraft's advanced avionics and weapons systems allow it to deliver precision-guided munitions with high accuracy. The F-16 has been credited with numerous aerial victories and successful ground strikes.

The F-16 has undergone continuous improvement throughout its service life. The Block 50/52 variants, for example, feature improved radar, engines, and avionics. The latest variant, the F-16V Viper, includes an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, a new mission computer, and other upgrades to keep the aircraft relevant in modern combat environments.

The F-16's fly-by-wire system was a revolutionary development in aircraft design. It replaced conventional mechanical flight controls with an electronic interface. The computer interprets the pilot's inputs and moves the control surfaces to achieve the desired maneuver. This system allows the F-16 to be inherently unstable, which increases its agility and responsiveness. The computer constantly adjusts the control surfaces to maintain stable flight, making the aircraft easier to fly.

The F-16's cockpit is designed to maximize pilot performance. The bubble canopy provides 360-degree visibility, allowing the pilot to see threats from all directions. The side-stick controller allows for precise control inputs, even under high g-forces. The reclined seat helps the pilot sustain higher g-loads without losing consciousness.

The F-16 has been a major export success, with thousands of aircraft sold to allies around the world. This widespread use has created a global network of support and logistics, ensuring that the F-16 will remain operational for many years. The aircraft's affordability and capability make it an attractive option for many air forces.

The F-16's combat record is impressive. It was used extensively in the Gulf War, the Balkans, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Israeli F-16s were used in the 1981 raid on the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq, a mission that demonstrated the aircraft's long-range strike capabilities. The F-16 has also been used by Pakistan, Turkey, and other nations in various conflicts.

In conclusion, the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon is a remarkable aircraft that has set the standard for multirole fighters. Its innovative design, versatility, and combat effectiveness have made it a legend in aviation history. The F-16's legacy will continue as it serves in air forces around the world, adapting to new challenges and technologies. It is truly a global fighter.
